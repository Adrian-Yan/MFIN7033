# MFIN7033

This is the collection of MFIN7033 final project. Each individual task is wrapped in a folder. Each folder contains an `.ipynb` file  and a `.py` file. Both files contain the same code, I recommend you to read the `.ipynb` file since it shows output in an explicit way.


For the Web-scrapping projects, I initially finished the reddit and weather, but forgot to register the googlesheet. So I chose the Sciencedirect website and Hong Kong SFC website.
